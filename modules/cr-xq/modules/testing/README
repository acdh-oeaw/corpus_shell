Testing module
**************

provides three different testing modes:
- the existing test-module "http://exist-db.org/xquery/testing";
- specialized functions to test rest-interfaces (reads in urls via httpclient) and evaluates xpaths on them
- the same but internally executed xpath instead of http-call


provides web-ui:
http://localhost:8080/exist/rest/db/cr/testing/tests.xql

config defines available testsets and targets (for the rest-tests)

one testrun is defined by combination of testset and target
and can be run (result is stored) or the result viewed
+ there is an overview: where all the combinations of testsets and targets are plotted.
