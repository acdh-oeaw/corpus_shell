 query_input
****************

This is (will be) a separate javascript module, that allows customizable query_input,
main feature being the ability to parse the input on the fly, 
with a pure javascript parser.
Currently, the parser supports (a simplified version of) SRU/CQL:
http://www.loc.gov/standards/sru/specs/cql.html

and is being generated with the jscc library:
http://jscc.phorward-software.com/

Files:
	cql_grammar.par
			The source file for the parser, with the grammar and 
			the invocation code and functions that are called during the parsing, to generate a parse tree

	cql_parser.js
			the generated parser in javascript

	dict.js
	    a helper file, containing a dictionary allowing to translate the parse tree into a verbose form.
	    currently, this is an old version from previous project, 
	    mainly added to be able to call the containing function (translateNode())
	    
The generation call (once you install jscc):
>jscc -o cql_parser.js cql_grammar.par

Dependencies
Next to JSCC, obviously, to generate the javascript code, 
on runtime following external code is used:
